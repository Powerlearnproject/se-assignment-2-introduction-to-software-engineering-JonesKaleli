# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools for the development and maintenance of high quality software systems which involves design, development, testing, deployment and maintenace of the product.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools for the development and maintenance of high quality software systems which involves design, development, testing, deployment and maintenace of the product while software Development Life Cyle consists of several phases including Requirements, design, Implementation, testing, deployment and maintenance of the software.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models: Agile iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to changes while waterfall is the sequential approach with distinct phases e.g requirement, design and implementation  following downward like waterfall

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? their key difference is, waterfall focuses on the requirements, design and implementation while Agile focuses on fexibility, collaboration and how it responds to changes.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle. Requirement engineering is the process of defining , documenting and maintaining requirements which involves activities like analysis, specification and verification to ensure the software meets the needs.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? modularity in software is a fundamental design aimed at creating software in a way that minimizes dependence among the components of a system. it hels to localize the impact changes, simplifies maintenance and enhances the understandability of the syatem.
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing Testing of individual components, integration testing-Testing of integrated component, system testing-Testing the entire system, acceptance testing-Testing the final system). Why is testing crucial in software development? to improve consistency and performance
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features. version control systems are softwares tools that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping a track of modification. Examples include github
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects? The role of a software manager is to oversee the planning, execution and delivery of software projects. The challenges that the project manager may face, include changing requirements, Tight deadlines, and Technical depts.
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle? software maintenace is the process of providing ongoing support, updates and enhancement of the software after deployment. Types of software maintenace include Corrective software engineering-addresses the faults and errors withing software application, Adaptive software engineering-this is the updating services or modification caused by change of organization policies, Perfective engineering-focuses on the evolution of requirements and features that existing in your systems and Preventive software engineering
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work? Bias Application, misinformation, and private concern. software engineers can adhere to the ethical standards in their work by following the regulatory framework and industry standards and also adopting responsible AI development practices.
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
